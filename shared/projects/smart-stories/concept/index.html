            <h2 class=" mt-0 text-center">The main idea:<br />Automated Virtual Reality</h2>
            <p>The main idea behind Smart Stories is to record the information gathered through sensors and radars
              available on smart vehicles and through Bluetooth devices such as the 360° camera and microphones, and
              view it in an automatically registered story.</p>
            <p>All the data and media is collected in a mobile App that automatically generates a virtual tour and a
              video with the summary of a certain route (Story), which can be shared or saved. This App is also used for
              visualization of routes (Stories) made and shared by other people in Virtual Reality. It allows traveling
              virtually, following a route either by using a map that displays the geographic location or through
              hotspots available when you open the 360° view.</p>
            <p>Stories can be registered automatically or in a customized mode, with the flexibility of importing or
              exporting routes and being able to share them easily. In automatic mode, the user starts his route freely
              and the App automatically records the information of the sensors and devices. The App then determines what
              information to record and when to record, using Artificial Intelligence. </p>
            <p>In the customized mode, it is possible to choose between record options and set the route path (Story) by
              importing a route or by creating one at the moment. You can create a route by searching on the map for
              suggested points of interest nearby the user and/or from friends’ Stories. Furthermore, the App has a
              practical Calendar to plan these Stories according to the start date of the trip.</p>

                  will be processed to create a unique visual experience. This is made possible by the ability of the
                  Smart Stories system to understand when there are worthy highlights on the route, from the data it
                  collects.</p>
                <p>In the final stage of the Story, the user will always have the possibility to review and edit the
